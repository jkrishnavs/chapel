semantic: should you be able to write the generated type as an argument type?

When you create an instance using the more unusual type functions, in order to
specify which instantiation you require for a function argument, should you be
able to write the exact output a writeln of the type would give, or are you
required to specify it in the same form as you would for a local variable
declaration?
