semantic: what happens when multiple initializers would match to same declaration?

Should we:
- Error when someone tries to declare an instance that would use one of them,
  since we can't distinguish between wanting the generic var version or the type
  argument version?
- Resolve the conflict by choosing the one with more type arguments, and
  document this decision?

Switching between these two choices should not be too difficult.
